        <p>
          I am a <span id="age">27</span> year old Web Developer who has been coding
          <span id="coding-for">since May 4<sup>th</sup> 2016</span>, and I am based close to the city of Bath in the UK.</p>
        <br aria-hidden="true" />
        <p>I currently work for <a href="https://animalfriends.co.uk">Animal Friends Insurance</a> in Amesbury as a Front End Web Developer.</p>
        <br aria-hidden="true" />
        <p>My main focus is working with the front end, but I do have a growing interest in back end development too, especially when it comes to MEAN stacks. I am passionate about everything and anything to do with the web, and I love trying out new tools. I'm forward thinking, determined, and I'm always keen to take on new challenges. If I'm not writing code, I'm busy with my band.
